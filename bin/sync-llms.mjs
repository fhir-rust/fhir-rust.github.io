//
// The workspace-root llms.txt/llms.json (spec/llms-json-and-llms-txt/) use
// links relative to the repository root -- correct there, but they only
// resolve inside a git checkout. Serving that text verbatim at
// <this site>/llms.txt would ship links that mostly 404 on this domain, since
// this site renders the monorepo's Markdown under its own routes rather than
// at their raw repository paths (see src/lib/paths.js). So this script does
// not copy the files: it rewrites every entry to wherever it actually
// resolves from this site's own domain -- a site route where the document is
// published here, the source repository otherwise -- using the exact same
// routeFor()/sourceUrl() mapping every other synced page's links go through.
//
// Per spec/llms-json-and-llms-txt/index.md, "Publishing a copy on a site".
//
// Source: $WORKSPACE if set, else this site's own parent directory — see
// bin/sync-content.mjs for why it is no longer a sibling checkout.
// Run after either workspace file changes:  npm run sync:llms
